# Mail
This app is built with AngularJs and Gmail Javascript API. This has been a very short and fun project for me to revise Angular as it has been a while.. 
I also got to study the Authentication methods with Google OAuth2 and it was really challenging at the beginning when it comes to queues, deferring and asynchronous loading.
It has *very* limited features for the time being but I still got bunch of feature ideas that I did not have time to implement.

## Getting started
Well basically it runs on *http://localhost:3000* (this is important) so you will need to start a local server. I prefer just to start a simple PHP server:
```
php -S localhost:3000
```

## Feature list
- [x] Sign in/out with Google OAuth2
- [x] List emails (ordered) from Inbox folder
- [x] Display personal data
- [x] Load emails on click
- [x] Routing authentication redirects
- [ ] Search emails
- [ ] Category views
- [ ] Infinite scroll (no need for clicks)
